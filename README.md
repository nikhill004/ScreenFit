## 💡 Why Digital Calories?

We track food calories to control physical health.  
But no one tracks “attention calories” which damage your **mental health**.

Digital Wellness gives a new unit → **Digital Calories**

| Action | Calories |
|--------|----------|
| 5 min Reel scrolling | 20 cal |
| 30 min YouTube binge | 120 cal |
| 1 hr gaming | 180 cal |

Lower calories = Cleaner Mind.
